# airflow_local
This repo contains the DAGs that run on my local Airflow dev environment. I use the local environment to test my DAGs before deploying them to virtual machines via Kubernetes

# Structure of the Folder
The folder is divided into two folders ```dags``` and ```sql_queries```. The folder ```dags``` contains the Py scripts that create the DAGs. It also contains two additional subfolders
